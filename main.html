    <p>Coffee is a warm, aromatic drink made from roasted coffee beans, treasured for its deep flavor, natural bitterness, and soothing fragrance. With every sip, it delivers a balance of bold taste and comforting warmth, awakening the mind and lifting the mood. Whether enjoyed black, creamy, sweet, or brewed with spices, coffee is more than a beverage — it’s a daily ritual, a moment of pause, and a source of energy that helps people start their day, stay focused, and feel refreshed.</p>

        <h2 style="color: brown;">Types Of Coffee☕</h2>
        <dt>🟤 Brewed Coffee Types</dt>
        <dd>- Brewed coffee is made by extracting flavor from roasted coffee grounds with hot or cold water, creating a smooth, aromatic drink that highlights the natural taste and aroma of the beans. It’s simple, fresh, and enjoyed as a daily comfort across the world.</dd>
        <dt>🟤 Milk-Based Coffee Types</dt>
        <dd>- Milk-based coffee combines espresso with steamed milk and foam to create a smooth, creamy drink that softens the intensity of pure espresso. It highlights a balance of rich coffee flavor and velvety texture, making it comforting, versatile, and popular among people who enjoy a gentler, more indulgent coffee experience.</dd>
        <dt>🟤 Strong & Traditional Variants</dt>
        <dd>- Strong and traditional coffee variants are bold, concentrated preparations that preserve the pure intensity of the beans. They use minimal milk or additions, focusing on deep flavor, high aroma, and a powerful caffeine kick. These methods—often rooted in cultural traditions—deliver a rich, robust experience that highlights coffee in its most authentic and full-bodied form.</dd>
        <dt>🟤 Flavored & Dessert-Style Coffees</dt>
        <dd>- Flavored and dessert-style coffees blend espresso with sweet ingredients like chocolate, caramel, syrups, spices, or ice cream to create rich, indulgent drinks. They focus more on taste and enjoyment than strength, offering creamy textures, sweet flavors, and a dessert-like experience that feels comforting and fun.</dd>
        <dt>🟤 Instant & Quick Types</dt>
        <dd>- Instant and quick coffee types are fast, convenient beverages made from pre-brewed, dehydrated coffee that dissolves easily in hot water. They offer a simple, no-equipment way to enjoy coffee, delivering quick flavor and caffeine with minimal preparation—ideal for busy moments or everyday use.</dd>
